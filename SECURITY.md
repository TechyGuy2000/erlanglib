## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Direct Reporting**: Send an email to our security team detailing the vulnerability. Please make sure to include as much information as possible, including steps to reproduce if applicable.

2. **Expect Regular Updates**: Once your report is received, you can expect an initial response within 48 hours. We will evaluate the vulnerability and determine its impact. Updates on the progress will be provided at least once a week until a final decision is made.

3. **Vulnerability Handling**:
   - If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and provide a timeline depending on its severity and complexity.
   - If the vulnerability is declined (for example, if it's determined to be a non-issue or something that cannot be fixed), we will provide a clear explanation of the reasoning.

We appreciate your help and patience in improving the security of our project. Your contribution is invaluable, and we aim to handle vulnerabilities with the utmost care for our user community.
